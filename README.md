# PalWorld-Sercer-Unoffical-Fix
This is an unofficial palworld server binary distribution project that fixes some problems with the original server.

## Fix what?
- [x] Memory leak and high cpu load from ```SymbolInfoToHumanReadableString```
- [x] Memory leak and high cpu load from ```ProgramCounterToHumanReadableString```
- [x] Memory leak and high cpu load from ```PopulateProgramCounterSymbolInfoFromSymbolFile```
- [ ] Disable profiling tracing
- [ ] Fix save broken

## How to use?
Download binary from [Release](https://github.com/VeroFess/PalWorld-Server-Unoffical-Fix/releases). Just overwrite the official files with the files I provided.

## It's safe?
Well, I personally swear not to insert harmful code, but if you don't believe me you can check using a tool like bindiff.
